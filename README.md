## Hi there 👋
# Hi, I'm Otto Szarata

I'm a Full-Stack Developer with 15 years of experience building web applications. I recently moved to Victoria, BC, Canada and I'm looking for opportunities in software development.

## What I Do

I build web applications using PHP and Laravel. I also work with JavaScript, MySQL, Bootstrap, and REST APIs. Most of my projects are business management systems, inventory platforms, and client portals.
